The frontend is built on the Expo framework, which is built around React Native.

It is written in Typescript - which is a superset of Javascript, it adds a ton of features including better stability as opposed to vanilla Javascript.

## Expo
Expo is a framework and a platform for universal React applications. It is a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that help you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps from the same JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.
